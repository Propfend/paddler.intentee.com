Paddler helps you host open-source models on your own infrastructure. 

## Cost control

Using closed-source services like OpenAI or Anthropic forces you into depending on their per-token pricing, which you don't have control over and can't fully predict.

With self-hosting, the costs are fixed and predictable. With enough scale, using a self-hosting approach comes with lower costs than the closed-source alternatives.


## Data privacy

Using models you own on your own infrastructure means you can eliminate third-party data processing. Your organization's and users' data never leaves your infrastructure. This keeps the data more secure and, more importantly, gives you full control over how the security around data is deployed. It helps you stay aligned with compliance requirements.

## Reliability and independence

Using closed-source models makes you dependent on your provider's availability and performance. An obvious risk is that when their API goes down, your AI features go down with it.

A less obvious but more serious issue, though, is uncontrolled updates to closed-source models.

When closed-source providers update their models, it can fundamentally change how your product behaves - altering response styles, tone, and reasoning patterns that your users have come to expect. The more AI-based features you have in your product (copilots, automated customer support, natural language interfaces), the more these uncontrolled changes disrupt your entire user experience.

The self-hosted approach and owning the models you use in your product make you independent from model updates and give you full control over the user experience the model creates in your product.
