Before starting, we recommend to have a basic understanding of the following concepts:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) - the version control system used by Paddler.
- System commands - Paddler is a command-line tool, so you should be comfortable with running commands in your terminal. You should know how to install and run custom commands in your system.
- Networking - Paddler starts networking services, so you should understand the basics of networking, such as IP addresses and ports.

These concepts are not strictly required, but they will help you understand how Paddler works and how to use it effectively.
