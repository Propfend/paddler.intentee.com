Paddler is an open-source LLMOps platform written in Rust that simplifies self-hosting of open source LLMs at scale.

It provides inference via a built-in llama.cpp engine, load balancing capabilities based on its own implementation of the llama.cpp server and slots system, and comes with rich management options both via API and a built-in web admin panel.
